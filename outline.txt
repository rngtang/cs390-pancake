Outline Ideas:

Hidden location: Somewhere in the Colab

Hiding the password:

One false password:
    A hidden string, each character xor'ed out
    Call a false password function, whose message is also xored out

String obfuscation:
    initiate the data string into a bunch of words
    one word will be encrypted much like how Ramada encrypted theirs (initiate data, char x = y * y * y)
    one word will be easy, xor'ed out
    one word will
